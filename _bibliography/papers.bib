  abstract ={The presence of melatonin in plants, called phytomelatonin, has gained great interest in recent years. The determination of phytomelatonin levels in plant extracts for both physiological and plant foodstuff studies requires sophisticated techniques due to the low endogenous levels of this indolic compound with hormonal nature. This chapter presents the most common and advanced techniques in the determination of phytomelatonin, with special emphasis on the techniques of extraction, cleaning, separation, detection, identification, and quantification. Multiple examples and recommendations are presented for a clear overview of the pros and cons of phytomelatonin determinations in plant tissues, seeds, and fruits, mainly.},

  abstract = {Seed germination (GS) and seedling growth are vital plant stages that can be affected by stresses such as drought and aging, which cause deterioration and reduce seed viability. With the aim of homogenizing and improving GS, priming treatments with biostimulants such as the antioxidant melatonin are commonly used in seeds. In this study, the effects of melatonin on germination and seedling growth in two different situations, i.e., aging seeds of rice, barley, and sorghum and under polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced drought stress in sorghum, were studied. Aged seeds were primed for 7 days in different concentrations of melatonin, and drought stress seeds were primed for 24 h before PEG treatment for 7 days, and germination and initial growth parameters were monitored. Aging-seeds of rice and barley showed the maximum response in terms of germination percentage at 20 {\textmu}M melatonin and 0.05 {\textmu}M respectively; while aging-seeds of sorghum showed improvement in germination for practically all concentrations studied, even the highest tested at 50 {\textmu}M. Regarding the effect of melatonin treatments on drought stress in sorghum seeds, all the studied parameters showed a significant attenuation of the adverse effects of drought stress, alleviating them, for all concentrations tested but especially at 200 {\textmu}M melatonin. The results obtained confirm that priming seeds with melatonin under low germinability conditions relieves stress and improves both germination and seedling growth.},

The wide use of melatonin against sleep disorders and particular problems, such as jet lag, has been added to other applications, such as anti-aging, anti-stress, immune system activation, anticancer, and others, which have triggered its use, normally without a prescription. The chemical industry currently covers 100\% of the needs of the melatonin market. Motivated by sectors with more natural consumption habits, a few years ago, the possibility of obtaining melatonin from plants, called phytomelatonin, arose. More recently, the pharmaceutical industry has developed genetically modified microorganisms whose ability to produce biological melatonin in bioreactors has been enhanced. This paper reviews the aspects of the chemical and biological synthesis of melatonin for human consumption, mainly as dietary supplements. The pros and cons of obtaining melatonin from microorganisms and phytomelatonin from plants and algae are analyzed, as well as the advantages of natural melatonin, avoiding unwanted chemical by-products from the chemical synthesis of melatonin. Finally, the economic and quality aspects of these new products, some of which are already marketed, are analyzed.},

In this work, we present a review of several aspects of the ABTS/TAC, highlighting the major achievements that have made this method so widely used, e.g., ABTS radical formation in hydrophilic or lipophilic reaction media, measurement strategies, automatization, and adaptation to high-throughput systems, as well as the pros and cons.

Chevall. that grows wild in northern Morocco (the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region). The phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined by spectrophotometer methods, and the composition of derivatized methanolic extracts from C. mixtus using N-O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) was analyzed by gas chromatography--mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antioxidant activity was carried out by applying the 2,2{$\prime$}-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) tests. The micro-dilution technique was chosen to investigate the antimicrobial activity of methanolic extracts against two bacterial strains and three fungal species. The results showed that the values of total phenolic and flavonoid contents were found to be higher in flower extracts (30.55 {\textpm} 0.85 mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g of dried weight (DW) and 26.00 {\textpm}1.34 mg of quercetin equivalents (QE)/g DW, respectively). Other groups of chemical compounds were revealed by GC-MS, such as carbohydrates (27.25--64.87\%), fatty acids (1.58--9.08\%), organic acids (11.81--18.82\%), and amino acids (1.26--7.10\%). Root and flower methanolic extracts showed the highest antioxidant activity using ABTS (39.49 mg of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g DW) and DPPH (36.23 mg TE/g DW), respectively. A positive correlation between antioxidant activity and polyphenol and flavonoid amounts was found. Antibacterial tests showed that the best activity was presented by the leaf extract against Staphylococcus aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) = 20 mg/mL) and Escherichia coli (MIC of 30 mg/mL and MBC of 35 mg/mL). S. aureus was more sensitive to the extracts compared to E. coli. All extracts showed antifungal activity against Trichophyton rubrum, with the best efficacy reported by the flower and leaf extracts (MIC = 1.25 mg/mL and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) = 2.5 mg/mL). In general, extracts of C. mixtus appeared less effective against Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus.},

Here, fresh-cut broccolini (baby broccoli or BIMI{\textregistered}) were treated with different concentrations of melatonin (50 and 100 {\textmu}M) for 15 or 30 min and cold stored for 28 days. Melatonin-treated broccolini had a longer shelf life than control samples, as seen by fresh weight (weight loss rate), hue angle (expresses color quality), and chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations. Treatments with 50 {\textmu}M melatonin for 15 min appear to be the most effective, reducing water loss by around 28\% compared to the control and increasing the shelf life of fresh-cut broccolini, presenting an optimal conservation time of 7 days, and this could even be extended up to 14 days with acceptable quality. In addition, antioxidant, phenolic, and flavonoid contents were improved in melatonin-treated broccolini plants. Lipid peroxidation damage by cold storage was decreased in melatonin-treated broccolini, with a relevant decrease in malondialdehyde contents, especially 50 {\textmu}M, on all days of storage. This study demonstrates for the first time the effectiveness of melatonin treatments in extending the shelf life of broccolini during cold storage. The possible commercial use of these treatments will be subject to the processes in the product management and marketing chain. However, more specific research about changes in organoleptic properties is necessary.},

In animals, melatonin is a hormone that is involved in a wide range of physiological activities and is also an excellent antioxidant. In plants, it has been considered a master regulator of multiple physiological processes as well as of hormonal homeostasis. Likewise, it is known for its role as a protective biomolecule and activator of tolerance and resistance against biotic and abiotic stress in plants. Since infections by pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and viruses in crops result in large economic losses, interest has been aroused in determining whether melatonin plays a relevant role in plant defense systems against pathogens in general, and against viruses in particular. Currently, several strategies have been applied to combat infection by pathogens, one of them is the use of eco-friendly chemical compounds that induce systemic resistance. Few studies have addressed the use of melatonin as a biocontrol agent for plant diseases caused by viruses. Exogenous melatonin treatments have been used to reduce the incidence of several virus diseases, reducing symptoms, virus titer, and even eradicating the proliferation of viruses such as Tobacco Mosaic Virus, Apple Stem Grooving Virus, Rice Stripe Virus and Alfalfa Mosaic Virus in tomato, apple, rice and eggplant, respectively. The possibilities of using melatonin as a possible natural virus biocontrol agent are discussed.},

These bio-residues are usually discarded losing the chance to obtain interesting bioactive compounds from them. In this work, we use the saffron bio-residues as possible source of natural bioactive compounds. Different extraction conditions were applied obtaining hydrophilic and lipophilic components. The antioxidant activity of the bioactive compounds in the different conditions were analysed using the ABTS method developed by our team. Furthermore, the total content of phenolic compounds and flavonoids present in the bio-residues were estimated. We demonstrated that bio-residues contain a high amount of both phenolic and flavonoid compounds with a strong antioxidant potential effect. Moreover, we compared the antioxidant activities of saffron bio-residues (obtained from stamens, tepals, and stigmas). The extraction was made at two different pH (4.5 and 7.5) and measured (antioxidant activity, flavonoid and phenol content) at pH 7.5. Another extraction done at pH 7.5 measured antioxidant activity, flavonoid and phenol content at time 0 (t = 0 h) and after 24 h (t = 24 h) at pH 4.5 and 7.5. We point out that bioresidues contain antioxidant activity (up to 8.42 {\textmu}moles Trolox/100 g DW), total phenols (up to 111.91 {\textmu}moles EG/100 g DW) and total flavonoids (up to 109.25 {\textmu}moles QE/100 g DW) as bioactive compounds. The applicability of bio-residues as additives is promising, both in the pharmaceutical and in the food industry as nutraceuticals and phytogenics.

Here, we study the classical tomato mutation rosette (ro), which lacks shoot-borne roots. ro mutants were severely inhibited in formation of wound-induced roots (WiRs) and had reduced auxin transport rates. We mapped ro to the tomato ortholog of the Arabidopsis thaliana BIG and the mammalians UBR4/p600. RO/BIG is a large protein of unknown biochemical function. In A. thaliana, BIG was implicated in regulating auxin transport and calcium homeostasis. We show that exogenous calcium inhibits WiR formation in tomato and A. thaliana ro/big mutants. Exogenous calcium antagonized the root-promoting effects of the auxin indole-3-acetic-acid but not of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, an auxin analog that is not recognized by the polar transport machinery, and accumulation of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) was sensitive to calcium levels in the ro/big mutants. Consistent with a role for calcium in mediating auxin transport, both ro/big mutants and calcium-treated wild-type plants were hypersensitive to treatment with polar auxin transport inhibitors. Subcellular localization of BIG suggests that, like its mammalian ortholog, it is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Analysis of subcellular morphology revealed that ro/big mutants exhibited disruption in cytoplasmic streaming. We suggest that RO/BIG maintains auxin flow by stabilizing PIN membrane localization, possibly by attenuating the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on cytoplasmic streaming.},

We present a review of phytomelatonin that considers its roles in plant metabolism and in particular its interactions with plant hormone network. In the primary metabolism of plants, melatonin improves the rate and efficiency of photosynthesis, as well related factors such as stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2, and Rubisco activity. It has also been shown to down-regulate some senescence transcription factors. Melatonin up-regulates many enzyme transcripts related to carbohydrates (including sucrose and starch), amino acids, and lipid metabolism, optimizing N, P, and S uptake. With respect to the secondary metabolism, clear increases in polyphenol, glucosinolate, terpenoid, and alkaloid contents have been described in numerous melatonin-treated plants. Generally, the most important genes of these secondary biosynthesis pathways have been found to be up-regulated by melatonin. The great regulatory capacity of melatonin is a result of its control of the redox and plant hormone networks. Melatonin acts as a plant master regulator, up-/down-regulating different plant hormone levels and signalling, and is a key player in redox homeostasis. It has the capacity to counteract diverse critical situations such as pathogen infections and abiotic stresses, and provide plants with varying degrees of tolerance. We propose possible future applications of melatonin for crop improvement and post-harvest product preservation.},

Its discovery in plants in 1995 has led to a great diversity of molecular and physiological studies that have been showing its multiple actions also in plants. Its roles as a biostimulator and modulator agent of responses to abiotic and biotic stresses have been widely studied. This review raises the possible use of melatonin as a natural safener in herbicide treatments. Existing studies have shown excellent co-acting qualities between both the following agents: herbicide and melatonin. The presence of melatonin reduces the damage caused by the herbicide in the crop and enhances the stress antioxidant response of plants. In this area, a similar role is suggested in the co-action between fungicides and melatonin, where a synergistic response has been demonstrated in some cases. The possible reduction in the fungicide doses is proposed as an eco-friendly advance in the use of these pesticides in certain crops. Finally, future research and applied actions of melatonin on these pest control agents are suggested.},

The role of melatonin as a beneficial agent in seedling grown mainly in cabbage and rapeseed and in the postharvest preservation of broccoli is especially analyzed. The beneficial effect of melatonin treatments on the organoleptic properties of these commonly consumed vegetables can be of great interest in the agri-food industry. Melatonin application extends the shelf life of fresh-cut broccoli while maintaining optimal visual and nutritional parameters. In addition, an integrated model indicating the role of melatonin on the organoleptic properties, the biosynthesis of glucosinolates and the regulatory action of these health-relevant compounds with anti-oncogenic activity is presented.},

The results showed the presence of phytomelatonin in all the samples analyzed.

The recommended daily doses of valerian are analyzed according to their phytomelatonin content, and recommendations are given on the possible synergistic action of the components of valerian as a relaxant and sleep inducer in patients with these dysfunctions.

Here, we characterized AR formation in young seedlings of Solanum lycopersicum cv. `Micro-Tom' after whole root excision by means of physiological, genetic and molecular approaches. We found that a regulated basipetal auxin transport from the shoot and local auxin biosynthesis triggered by wounding are both required for the re-establishment of internal auxin gradients within the vasculature. This promotes cell proliferation at the distal cambium near the wound in well-defined positions of the basal hypocotyl and during a narrow developmental window. In addition, a pre-established pattern of differential auxin responses along the apical-basal axis of the hypocotyl and an as of yet unknown cell-autonomous inhibitory pathway contribute to the temporal and spatial patterning of the newly formed ARs on isolated hypocotyl explants. Our work provides an experimental outline for the dissection of wound-induced AR formation in tomato, a species that is suitable for molecular identification of gene regulatory networks via forward and reverse genetics approaches.},

  abstract = {The animal hormone melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a pleiotropic molecule with multiple and various functions. Phytomelatonin is the melatonin from plants and was discovered in 1995 in some species. Phytomelatonin is considered an interesting molecule in the physiology of plants, as it seems to be involved in many actions, such as germination, growth, rooting and parthenocarpy, including fruit set and ripening; it also seems to play a role during postharvest. It has been studied in processes such as primary and secondary metabolism, photosynthesis and senescence, as well as in the nitrogen and sulfur cycles. Phytomelatonin up- and down-regulates many relevant genes related to plant hormones and key genes related to the above-mentioned aspects. One of the most decisive aspects of phytomelatonin is its relevant role as a bioprotective and alleviating agent against both biotic and abiotic stressors, which has opened up the possibility of using melatonin as a phytoprotector and biostimulant in agriculture. In this respect, using material of plant origin to obtain extracts rich in phytomelatonin instead of using synthetic melatonin (thus avoiding unwanted by-products) has become a topic of discussion. This work characterized the phytomelatonin-rich extracts obtained from selected herbs and determined their contents of phytomelatonin, phenols and flavonoids; the antioxidant activity was also measured. Finally, two melatonin-specific bioassays in plants were applied to demonstrate the excellent biological properties of the natural phytomelatonin-rich extracts obtained. The herb composition and the protocols for obtaining the extracts rich in phytomelatonin are in the process of registration for their legal protection.},

C. mixtus had a higher phenolic content (115.25 mg GAE g -1 DW) than M. chamomilla (82.99 mg GAE g-1 DW). However, flavonoid content of both plants was very close (33.53 and 32.45 mg QE g-1 DW in M. chamomilla and C. mixtus, respectively).

In cultivated carnations, an increased auxin level in the stem cutting base produced by active auxin transport from the leaves triggers adventitious root (AR) formation from the cambium. To provide additional insight into the physiological and genetic basis of this complex trait, we studied AR formation in a collection of 159 F1 lines derived from a cross between two hybrid cultivars (2003 R 8 and 2101-02 MFR) showing contrasting rooting performances. In three different experiments, time-series for several stem and root architectural traits were quantified in detail in a subset of these double-cross hybrid lines displaying extreme rooting phenotypes and their parental genotypes. Our results indicate that the water content and area of the AR system directly contributed to the shoot water content and shoot growth. Moreover, morphometric data and rooting quality parameters were found to be associated with some stress-related metabolites such as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), the ethylene precursor, and the conjugated auxin indol-3-acetic acid-aspartic acid (IAA-Asp).},

We provided molecular evidence that localized auxin response in the stem cutting base was required for efficient adventitious rooting in this species, which was dynamically established by polar auxin transport from the leaves. In turn, the bad-rooting behavior of the ``2003 R 8'' cultivar was correlated with enhanced synthesis of indole-3-acetic acid conjugated to aspartic acid by GH3 proteins in the stem cutting base. Treatment of stem cuttings with a competitive inhibitor of GH3 enzyme activity significantly improved rooting of ``2003 R 8''.

We found that stem cutting production declined during the harvest season in a cultivar-dependent manner.

Results: By whole transcriptome sequencing, we identified the genes involved in AR formation in carnation cuttings and in response to exogenous auxin.

We explored the kinetics of root primordia formation in these two cultivars and in response to exogenously-applied auxin through detailed histological and physiological analyses. Conclusions: Our results provide, for the first time, a number of molecular, histological and physiological markers that characterize the different stages of AR formation in this species and that could be used to monitor adventitious rooting on a wide collection of carnation germplasm with the aim to identify the best-rooting cultivars for breeding purposes..},

All irradiated clones examined presented lower seed numbers (from 0.23 to 2.47 seeds per fruit) and reduced pollen germination (from 1.40\% to 8.55\%) whereas the wild-type `Murcott' showed an average number of 9.03 seeds per fruit and a pollen germination value of 47.15\%.

High-performance liquid chromatographic methods were used to identify and quantify of these compounds, using photodiode array, mass and refractive index detectors. Our results indicated high contents in natural antioxidants as vitamin C (from 20.13 to 25.73 mg/100 mL) and phenolic compounds, as flavonoids, in these citrus varieties cultived under the Mediterranean climate. Some of these clones, which ripen late in the season and whose fruit quality is maintained or improved, are in the process of registration. In conclusion, budwood irradiation is a suitable technique to improve cultivars, produce seedless cultivars, adjust ripening time or raise the content of health-promoting compounds.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Citrus fruits have a beneficial effect on human health because of their nutritional and antioxidant properties, and their consumption is associated with a decrease in the incidence of cardiovascular disease and reduced risk of certain cancers. Seven cultivars of mandarin and orange species from the Mediterranean area, grafted onto different rootstocks (Cleopatra mandarin and Troyer citrange), have been analysed. The influence of the rootstock on the content of bioactive compounds is discussed. RESULTS: In all citrus cultivars and rootstocks studied, hesperidin and narirutin flavonoids were the main flavanone glycosides identified, {$\beta$}-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin the most abundant carotenoids, limonene was the most abundant essential oil, calcium and potassium were the dominant macronutrients and, among the micronutrients, iron and boron represented the highest proportions. CONCLUSION: We have been found clear differences in the content of bioactive compounds for the different groups, in agreement with the Citrus classification. Although both mandarin and orange varieties showed similar tendencies concerning the majority of bioactive constituents, the proportion of the individual nutrients ranged among different cultivars and our results indicated differences between rootstocks although it would be necessary to carry out more analyses, and with the new rootstocks obtained from different breeding programmes, to elucidate conclusive values.},

A large cellular pool of antioxidant metabolites is involved in their control. Variations in this antioxidant pool may be monitored by measuring changes in hydrophilic antioxidant activity (free radical-quenching activity of water-soluble components) and ascorbic acid levels. The de-etiolation process and induction of light stress in Avena sativa and Triticum aestivum leaves were used as physiological models to study the antioxidant status at different ages. The data showed that five-day-old green plants and de-etiolated plants of the same age have similar hydrophilic antioxidant activity (∼8 μmol ASC equivalents g FW−1), which increases during the de-etiolation process. In oat and wheat, young leaves (five days old) had higher antioxidant status (hydrophilic antioxidant activity and ascorbic acid level) than old leaves (10 and 20 days old). High-light treatment caused a decrease in antioxidant status, especially in young leaves. Hydrophilic antioxidant activity and ascorbic acid levels recovered totally or partially after 30 or 60 min in the dark. This capacity also depends on age and species. The ascorbic acid/hydrophilic antioxidant activity ratio is presented as an indicator of antioxidant variations in response to stress, but taking into account the absolute levels of antioxidants.},

In the present study, the role of melatonin as a growth promoter is extended to coleoptiles of canary grass, wheat, barley and oat, in which it shows a relative auxinic activity [with respect to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the main auxin in plants] of between 10 and 55\%. In addition, melatonin is seen to have an important inhibitory growth effect on roots similar to that played by auxin. The quantitation by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection and identification by tandem mass spectrometry of melatonin and IAA in etiolated coleoptiles of the monocots assayed showed that both compounds are present in similar levels in these tissues. These results point to the co-existence of auxin and melatonin in tissues and raises the possibility of their co-participation in some physiological actions as auxinic hormones in plants.},

The data presented in this study demonstrate that melatonin plays a physiological role in plant tissues.

The most important members of the family are the plant hormone, indole-3-acetic acid, and the animal hormone, melatonin. An important characteristic of some indolic compounds is that they may be useful as chemical preventive agents against diseases such as cancer, oxidative stress, etc. For this reason, the possible antioxidant activities (free radical-scavenging activity) of several indoles were studied. The2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid /H2O2/HRP decoloration method was applied to determine both hydrophilic (in buffered media) and lipophilic (in organic media) antioxidant properties of the indolic compounds.

HAA and ascorbic acid remained practically unchanged, while the levels of aqueous phenols increased during ripening. The levels of ascorbic acid and HAA were strongly correlated (r=0.90, P<0.1). β-Carotene increased until breaker and pink stages, decreasing afterwards. In contrast, lycopene accumulated throughout the ripening period. The LAA followed the same pattern as lycopene and a good correlation was found (r=0.91, P<0.05). There was less difference between the measured and calculated LAA as the lycopene level increased, the discrepancy being lowest at the red-ripe stage, indicating the importance of lycopene as a lipophilic antioxidant in tomatoes.},

To assess the differences in protection between these plants, we determined, in two forests, changes in gas-exchange rates, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, chloroplast pigment content and total antioxidant activity (TAA) in different seasons, at different times of the day and in relation to leaf age. The end-point method used for TAA determination allowed the evaluation of the relative contribution of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants in leaf extracts. High correlations were obtained between lipophilic TAA and certain chloroplast pigment content, the highest contribution being provided by β-carotene and the components of the xanthophyll cycle (zeaxanthin + antheraxanthin, violaxanthin). All leaves showed a much higher contribution (94-99%) of hydrophilic than lipophilic antioxidants to TAA. In summer, at midday, photosynthetic rates and TAA were higher in resprouts. In these plants, reduced xanthophyll-cycle participation (as shown by non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and xanthophyll pool content) was compensated by an increased participation of hydrophilic antioxidants. No effect of time of day or plant age was observed. The results suggest that energy dissipation as heat, and detoxification mechanisms contribute to the protective strategies of control plants and resprouts, albeit to a different extent.},

Superoxide anions were generated non-enzymatically in a phenazine methosulphate-NADH system and assayed by reduction of nitro-blue tetrazolium.

Conversely, quercetin-3-sulphate and the flavonol aglycones, exhibited some pro-oxidant activity at the range of concentrations tested (0.5-10 {$\mu$}M). These results show that conjugation has a marked effect on the scavenging capacity of flavonols and that the type of conjugate at the 3-position determines the final superoxide scavenging capacity. Caffeic acid and ferulic acid showed no effect on the generation of superoxide anions by phenazine methosulphate-NADH. However, dimerization of ferulic acid enhanced the superoxide scavenging capacity of this hydroxycinnamic acid, but this depended on the type of linkage between the monomers.

The ABTS radical is easily generated in acidified ethanol medium in about 100 s with a stability of 1.7 × 10-3 (–Δabs/min) monitored at 730 nm. Other organic solvents, such as methanol or acetone, have lower radical generation times but the radical is less stable. The addition of Trolox or a lipophilic antioxidant such as α-tocopherol or β-carotene produces a decrease in absorbance that can be used to estimate antioxidant capacity. Using a spectrophotometric end-point method and microplate-reader equipment, we have developed a method that estimates the antioxidant activity of different lipophilic vitamins. The use of Trolox as an antioxidant standard led to a limit of detection of 0.08 nmoles and limit of quantitation of 0.28 nmoles, while similar values were obtained for α-tocopherol and β-carotene. The relative antioxidant activity values obtained by different antioxidants showed that α-tocopherol has a similar antioxidant potential to Trolox and that β-carotene has 2.6 times the antioxidant potential of Trolox. In our opinion, this method can be useful for estimating the antioxidant activity in lipophilic samples and as a complement to other methods that measure antioxidant activity in aqueous media.},

  abstract = {Peach fruit (Prunus persica L. cv. `Miraflores') harvested at the firm-ripe stage, treated or not with 2 g l-1 iprodione, were cooled or not at 1{$^\circ$}C and ripened at 15 or 20{$^\circ$}C and 95\% RH for 10 days. During ripening, weight loss, fungal development and changes in quality parameters (firmness, soluble solids content, titratable acidity, pH and ground and flesh color), and carbon dioxide and ethylene production were monitored. Cooling alone or combined with iprodione avoided Rhizopus nigricans decay during ripening at either ripening temperatures. A skin damage not previously reported on fungicide treated peach was observed at 20{$^\circ$}C. Cooled fruit ripened at 15{$^\circ$}C showed an anomalous respiration rate and ethylene production after the climacteric peak, a loss of firmness and a drop in titratable acidity after 7 days of storage, and reduced endo-polygalacturonase activity in presence of continuous pectinmethylesterase activity during the first week. Cooling before ripening at 20{$^\circ$}C led to the best flavor without excessive total losses. These results helped in the optimization of warming cycles during cold storage used to avoid chilling injuries development on peaches.

Strategies for measuring TAA are discussed, particularly the different methodological and instrumental approaches used. In addition, our own methods are presented in order to facilitate and speed up the manipulation of biological material. The values of TAA by different compounds are presented and compared.},

By subjecting the peaches to IW, woolliness was strongly reduced concomitantly with a sudden reduction in flesh firmness due to normal fruit ripening. During post-storage ripening, extractable juice and juiciness only decreased in conventionally stored (CS) fruit as a result of woolliness. However, the liquid phase of the juice extracted (clear juice) decreased in IW but not in woolly CS fruit. Clear juice reduction appeared to be related to normal advanced ripening, with differences between woolly and sound fruit associated with the ripening stage during storage. The technological and physiological implications of these quality indices, mainly related to ripening, senescence, and woolliness, are discussed. These results support the hypothesis that IW maintains cellular membrane integrity and helps the recovery of pectolytic enzymatic activity. It has been stated that the incidence of woolliness was more closely related to the juice release mechanism than to the clear juice content.},

  abstract = {Long life tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cultivar `Durinta') at breaker stage, treated with 0.5 g l-1 iprodione or washed in water, were stored at 9, 12 or 20{$^\circ$}C for up to 28 days. Fruit stored at 9{$^\circ$}C were warmed to 20{$^\circ$}C for 1 day every week, whereas fruit stored at 12{$^\circ$}C were cooled to 2{$^\circ$}C for 1 day every week. Fungicide treatment reduced decay and pitting on fruit stored more than 3 weeks. At 9{$^\circ$}C, a slight synergistic effect on fruit pitting was observed from fungicide alone or fungicide plus intermittent warming. Compared with fruit stored at a constant 9{$^\circ$}C, intermittently warmed tomatoes had better surface colour and flavour, were slightly less firm with less severe pitting, and were in better condition both at the end of the storage period and after a 3-day shelf-life. In fruit held at constant 20{$^\circ$}C, 9{$^\circ$}C or intermittently warmed, increased pectolytic enzyme activity accompanied a fall in respiration rate and ethylene production. In fruit held at a continuous 9{$^\circ$}C, polygalacturonase activity was reduced slightly during the third week of storage. Intermittently cooled fruit showed enhanced taste and appearance compared with fruit held at a constant 12{$^\circ$}C, but had more decay and pitting after the second cooling treatment. After cooling, slight reductions in L*a*b* Colour Space lightness were detected. During the shelf-life period, tomatoes previously stored continuously for 2 or 3 weeks at 9 or 12{$^\circ$}C produced more ethylene and had higher respiration rates. By the third week, ethylene production was severely reduced by cooling at 2{$^\circ$}C, but a possible relationship between pitting and non-ripening-dependent ethylene production was indicated. The respiration rate was not affected by the disorder incidence. We conclude that intermittent warming is more beneficial than intermittent cooling because of pitting development at 2{$^\circ$}C in intermittently cooled fruit.},

A kinetic approach to explain this lag time is presented, which also makes it possible to determine the amount of L-ascorbic acid in the reaction medium. The stoichiometry of the system was determined as 1 mol of L-ascorbic reducing 2 mol of ABTS radicals. L-Ascorbic acid is not the only compound to have this ability, since other antioxidant compounds also react with the ABTS radical. We studied the ABTS/H2O2/horseradish peroxidase system in the presence of L-ascorbic acid and other antioxidant compounds. The influence of such factors as pH, enzyme concentration, and L-ascorbic acid concentration was studied. A good correlation between the lag time and the L-ascorbic acid present in the medium was observed, and under optimal conditions, the method could determine as little as 0.65 nmol of L-ascorbic acid. Based on our findings, we propose a method to measure the total antioxidant activity of different compounds related to L-ascorbic acid and apply this method to determining the total antioxidant activity present in fruit juices.},

Lupin seedlings were derooted and the hypocotyls treated for 24 h with aqueous solutions containing different concentrations. (from 10 {\textmu}M to 50 mM) of the above compounds. The hypocotyl length and the number and length of the adventitious roots were determined periodically. All the assayed compounds showed a capacity to inhibit growth and rooting of the hypocotyls, the effect being dependent on the compound and its concentration. As a rule, the greater the concentration, the higher the inhibition. The compounds can be classified from higher to lower efficiency as inhibitors as follows: mCPBA, GSH, ASC and H2O2; therefore, inhibitory efficiency is seemingly dependent on the compound per se rather than on its redox nature. The higher effectiveness as inhibitor of mCPBA and GSH is discussed in light of their capacity to inactivate enzymes such as peroxidases, which are involved in plant development and in the protective mechanism against oxidative stress. The fact that younger, actively growing tissues were less sensitive than older hypocotyl tissues to the toxicity of mCPBA and GSH supports the view of a changing endogenous redox state during growth. Data presented here suggest that regulation of the redox balance is decisive in regulating plant morphogenesis.},
